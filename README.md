# SIARD 2.0 specification and examples

SIARD (Software Independent Archival of Relational Databases) is a file format used in preservation of relational databases based on standards like XML and SQL:1999.

SIARD 1.0 was developed by the Swiss Federal Archives and has been a Swiss standard since 2013 ([eCH-0165](http://www.bar.admin.ch/dienstleistungen/00823/01911/index.html?lang=en&download=NHzLpZeg7t,lnp6I0NTU042l2Z6ln1ad1IZn4Z2qZpnO2Yuq2Z6gpJCDeIN,gGym162epYbg2c_JjKbNoKSn6A--)). It is supported by the [SIARD Suite](http://www.bar.admin.ch/dienstleistungen/00823/01911/index.html?lang=en) which is closed source but free to use after accepting the license aggreement.

A new version of SIARD is being developed under the [EARK project](http://www.eark-project.com/) and with the co-operation of the Swiss Federal Archives, including the development of a fully open-source tool that would support both versions of SIARD (1.0 and the new): the [database preservation toolkit](http://keeps.github.io/db-preservation-toolkit/). This new version of SIARD is not yet named, but proposed names include SIARD-E and SIARD 2.0.

Here you will be able to find the SIARD-E specification, XML schemas and documentation. For reference you will also find information SIARDDK and DBML, which are formats used by the Danish National Archive and the Portuguese National Archive.
