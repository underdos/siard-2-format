# SIARD 2.0 specification, E-ARK recommendation and examples 

Here you will find the SIARD 2.0 specification along with its XML schemas and examples (as files).

You will also find the E-ARK recommendation for the SIARD 2.0 feature of storing large objects outside the SIARD archive file along with examples.

For reference you will also find information on SIARDDK and DBML, which are formats used by the Danish National Archives and the Portuguese National Archives.

SIARD (Software Independent Archival of Relational Databases) is a format used in preservation of relational databases 

The SIARD format is based on standards including the ISO standards Unicode, XML, and SQL, the URI Internet standard, and the industry standard ZIP.
The aim of employing internationally recognised standards is to ensure the long-term preservation of, and access to, the widely used relational database model, as well as easy exchange of database content, independent of proprietary “dump” formats.

The SIARD 2.0 format is an extension of the standard eCH-0165 for the SIARD 1.0 format.

SIARD 1.0 was developed by the Swiss Federal Archives in 2008 and has been a Swiss standard since 2013 ([eCH-0165](http://www.bar.admin.ch/dienstleistungen/00823/01911/index.html?lang=en&download=NHzLpZeg7t,lnp6I0NTU042l2Z6ln1ad1IZn4Z2qZpnO2Yuq2Z6gpJCDeIN,gGym162epYbg2c_JjKbNoKSn6A--)).
It is supported by the [SIARD Suite](http://www.bar.admin.ch/dienstleistungen/00823/01911/index.html?lang=en) which is closed source but free to use after accepting the license aggreement.

SIARD 2.0 was developed under the [EARK project](http://www.eark-project.com/) by Hartwig Thomas, Enter AG, on behalf of the Swiss Federal Archives and by the E-ARK project partners. 

The E-ARK project is developing an open source tool the [database preservation toolkit](http://keeps.github.io/db-preservation-toolkit/) that supports the SIARD 2.0 formats as well as SIARD 1.0, SIARDDK and DBML.
